Stupid? Well you came to the right place. 


Sometimes I don't remember which Impacket script to use as I do Pentest Labs, and sometimes I just want to run all of them at once like a script kiddie, but dumber and lazier. I'm creating the script as a way to dump a ton of information at myself at once, hoping that something, anything, jogs my memory into accidentally doing something smart on autopilot. 

Pros: It easy.

Cons: Someone might see you, and if you live in an at-will state, you could be fired.
